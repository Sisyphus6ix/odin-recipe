    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>An easy crab legs recipe with a garlic butter sauce thats ready in just 20 minutes! I wanted something a little different from plain 
        steamed, boiled, or grilled crab legs, so I ended up throwing a few things together to make this awesome crab leg recipe. This dish would be great with shrimp as well. Enjoy!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound of Snow Crab clusters, thawed if necessary</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoon of dried parsley</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black petter</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut a slit length-wise, into the shell of each piece of crab</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet oven medium heat. Add garlic and cook until trasculent, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in parsley, pepper, and salt. Continue to heat mixture until bubbling.</li>
        <li>Add crab legs to the skillet; toss to coat with butter mixture. Simmer until completely heated through, 5 to 6 minutes</li>
    </ol>
